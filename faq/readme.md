## I need a private viewing without delay, what do I do?
You can leave it without delay and ask our Broadcast Team to create a new Broadcast with delay.

## What is the advantage of using the APP instead of using something else?
You won't have to rely on setting up a server to host your events or third-party services that don't want to be used as sources for other platforms. Furthermore, you will have easier access by delaying your event and movements will be more in real time.
